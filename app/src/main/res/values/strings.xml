    <!-- TYPES:
            String
                XML resource that provides a single string.
            String Array
                XML resource that provides an array of strings.
            Quantity Strings (Plurals)
                XML resource that carries different strings for pluralization.


Note:
A plurals collection is a simple resource that is referenced using the value provided in the name
attribute (not the name of the XML file). As such, you can combine plurals resources with other
simple resources in the one XML file, under one <resources> element.

<resources>
    <plurals
        name="plural_name">
        <item
            quantity=["zero" | "one" | "two" | "few" | "many" | "other"]
            >text_string</item>
    </plurals>
</resources>

DESCRIPTION:

    zero
        When the language requires special treatment of the number 0 (as in Arabic).
    one
        When the language requires special treatment of numbers like one (as with the number 1
        in English and most other languages; in Russian, any number ending in 1 but not ending
        in 11 is in this class).
    two
        When the language requires special treatment of numbers like two (as with 2 in Welsh, or
        102 in Slovenian).
    few
        When the language requires special treatment of "small" numbers (as with 2, 3, and 4
        in Czech; or numbers ending 2, 3, or 4 but not 12, 13, or 14 in Polish).
    many
        When the language requires special treatment of "large" numbers (as with numbers ending
        11-99 in Maltese).
    other
        When the language does not require special treatment of the given quantity (as with all
        numbers in Chinese, or 42 in English).

             As a developer, you should always supply "one" and "other"
             strings. Your translators will know which strings are actually
             needed for their language. Always include %d in "one" because
             translators will need to use %d for languages where "one"
             doesn't mean 1 (as explained above).

        Any of the following:

        Note that you must escape double quotes. Surrounding the string with single quotes does not work.
